                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a Computational Science Engineer with expertise across the entire <strong>numerical modeling chain</strong>, from developing and validating numerical codes to deploying them and using them for complex simulations. I work with both industrial solutions and open-source tools, and I optimize performance through <strong>high-performance computing (HPC)</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thanks to my adaptability, curiosity, and strong learning ability, I have gained professional experience in diverse teams, including research labs, engineering offices, and consulting firms. My projects span electromagnetism, solid mechanics, civil hydraulics, and computational fluid dynamics (CFD). These experiences have provided me with a comprehensive understanding of numerical modeling and its applications across scientific and industrial contexts.

                <p>
                    I have a strong interest in french literature and philosophy. I am also committed to volunteering and deeply
                    value social justice and equal opportunities. Between 2018 and 2020, I volunteered as an administrative assistant
                    at <em>La Perle Blanche</em>, an association supporting people with mental disabilities. I am currently involved
                    with <em>Tremplin Jeunesse</em>, an organization dedicated to mentoring and supporting young people in their
                    academic and professional paths.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Outside of my professional and volunteer activities, I enjoy weight training and running, which play an important 
                    role in mantaining balance and discipline.
