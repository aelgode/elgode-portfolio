                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a Computational Science Engineer with expertise across the entire <strong>numerical modeling chain</strong>, from developing and validating numerical codes to deploying them and using them for complex simulations. I work with both industrial solutions and open-source tools, and I optimize performance through <strong>high-performance computing (HPC)</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thanks to my adaptability, curiosity, and strong learning ability, I have gained professional experience in diverse teams, including research labs, engineering offices, and consulting firms. My projects span electromagnetism, solid mechanics, civil hydraulics, and computational fluid dynamics (CFD). These experiences have provided me with a comprehensive understanding of numerical modeling and its applications across scientific and industrial contexts.
